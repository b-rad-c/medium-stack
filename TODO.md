+ 游리 implement profiles
    + 游릭 router
    + 游릭 ops
    + 游릭 client
    + 游리 unittests

+ 游리 build out ops
    + 游릭 file uploader - move logic from router to ops
    + 游릭 profiles
    + 游릭 each type of file
    + 游릭 update router to use ops
    + 游댮 ops unittests

* 游댮 upgrade dockerfile(s) to python 3.12.3
    * 游댮 check if deps still needed
    * 游댮 check pytest warnings

+ 游리 update client to have matching ops api
    + 游리 update client unittests

+ 游릭 update unittests for users
    + 游릭 unique emails for users
    + 游릭 login procedure

+ 游릭 update file ingest
    + 游릭 create new file ingest methods for files that don't need to be uploaded (already on server)
    + 游릭 uploads should have a temp folder and be moved into long term storage folder after recieving CID
+ 游릭 add API endpoints for image files / releases
+ 游리 UI models :: users, file uploads, artists, image files, image releases, still images
    + 游릭 make a lorem ipsom generator for each ui model
    + 游릭 index page linking to other pages
    + 游리 for each ui model build components/pages for list, create (plus file upload), read, delete
        + 游리 users
        + 游리 file uploads
        + 游리 artists
        + 游리 image files
        + 游리 image releases
        + 游리 still images

+ 游리 update backend
    + 游릭 serve static files
    + 游댮 add backend widget and list item models for each content model that will be used to generate the front end models
    + 游댮 unittests

+ 游릭 UI auth
    + 游릭 login page
    + 游릭 account page
    + 游릭 create account

+ 游릭 add user auth
    + 游릭 web api
    + 游릭 client
    + 游릭 update unittests

+ 游리 file updates
    + 游릭 delete files
    + 游댮 file delete unittests
    + 游댮 file/upload background process unittests
    + 游댮 download file methods in ops/client
    + 游댮 s3 support

+ 游댮 migrate to yaml config

 
+ 游리 code templating
    + 游댮 db wrappers
    + 游리 ops -> wrap calls like delete because they need to be different for users/files/models with just data
    + 游리 client
    + 游댮 api routes -> uses above ops
    + 游댮 cli -> uses above ops
    + 游댮 model_config example(s) -> use lorem ipsom gen and hardcode correct cid
    + 游댮 generator function
    + 游댮 unittests              -> retain hard coded CIDs for data+files for testing CID type
    + 游댮 move mcore.util.example* funcs to model attributes


+ 游댮 remane StillImageCreator.id to StillImageCreator.cid -> and check for other similar naming problems
+ 游댮 refactor mart.TitleData model


        from:
            TitleData.title
            TitleData.short_title
            TitleData.abreviated_title
            ...
        to:
            TitleData.full
            TitleData.short
            TitleData.abreviated
            ...
    
        this way you wont have duplicate attributes when accessing via parent model

        StillImage.title.full
        StillImage.title.short
        StillImage.title.abreviated

        instead of

        StillImage.title.title
        StillImage.title.short_title
        StillImage.title.abreviated_title

        this should be done after code templating and generation so that new models, examples and unittests will be auto generated instead of manually updating CIDs

+ 游댮 profile groups

+ 游댮 add tests for seeder - these will also test that user login and item/creator ownership is working

+ 游댮 text editing
    + 游댮 find text editing libray
    + 游댮 update backend TextFile model for text editor serialilization format
    + 游댮 implement front end editor for text file editing

    + 游댮 models such as post, page, primatives for img/aud/vid with typical social media metadata, and widgets referencing other items/queries
        + 游댮 widget syntax for refrencencing other items
            + 游댮 art.artists.list()
            + 游댮 art.artists.id = '...'
            + 游댮 update code templating to create a dict lookup mapping commands to functions
    + 游댮 models that organize content
        + 游댮 feeds - chronological ordering of the above models (potentially limited to certain types)
        + 游댮 forum
            + 游댮 branch - wrapper around feed model 
            + 游댮 formum - container for branch, has metadata plus hierarchical tagging
    conversation threads (integrate with heirarcy/tag model for forkable conversations)

+ 游댮 minfo
    + 游댮 hierarchical sorting of 'fact' models
    + 游댮 'context' models can be added by anyone
